Preface by M. Nostradamus to His Prophecies 

Greetings and happiness to Cesar Nostradamus my son. Your late arrival, 
Cesar Nostredame, my son, has made me spend much time in constant nightly 
reflection so that I could communicate with you by letter and leave you this 
reminder, after my death, for the benefit of all men, of which the divine 
spirit has vouchsafed me to know by means of astronomy. And since it was the 
Almighty's will that you were not born here in this region and I do not want 
to talk of years to come but of the months during which you will struggle to 
grasp and understand the work I shall be compelled to leave you after my 
death: assuming that it will not be possible for me to leave you such writing 
as may be destroyed through the injustice of the age. The key to the hidden 
prediction which you will inherit will be locked inside my heart. 

Also bear in mind that the events here described have not yet come to pass, 
and that all is ruled and governed by the power of Almighty God, inspiring us 
not by bacchic frenzy nor by enchantments but by astronomical assurances: 
predictions have been made through the inspiration of divine will alone 
and the spirit of prophecy in particular. 

On numerous occasions and over a long period of time I have predicted 
specific events far in advance, attributing all to the workings of divine 
power and inspiration, together with other fortunate or unfortunate 
happenings, foreseen in their full unexpectedness, which have already come to 
pass in various regions of the earth. Yet I have wished to remain silent and 
abandon my work because of the injustice not only of the present time but 
also for most of the future. I will not commit to writing. 

Since governments, sects and countries will undergo such sweeping changes, 
diametrically opposed to what now obtains, that were I to relate events to 
come, those in power now - monarchs, leaders of sects and religions - would 
find these so different from their own imaginings that they would be led to 
condemn what later centuries will learn how to see and understand. Bear in 
mind also Our Saviour's words: "Do not give anything holy to the dogs, nor 
throw pearls in front of swine lest they trample them with their feet and 
turn on you and tear you apart." For this reason I withdrew my pen from the 
paper, because I wished to amplify my statement touching the Vulgar Advent by 
means of ambiguous and enigmatic comments about future causes, even those 
closest to us and those I have perceived, so that some human change which may 
come to pass shall not unduly scandalize delicate sensibilities. The whole 
work is thus written in a nebulous rather than plainly prophetic form. 
So much so that, "You have hidden these things from the wise and the 
circumspect, that is from the mighty and the rulers, and you have purified 
those things for the small and the poor," and through Almighty God's will, 
revealed unto those prophets with the power to perceive what is distant and 
thereby to foretell things to come. For nothing can be accomplished without 
this faculty, whose power and goodness work so strongly in those to whom 
it is given that, while they contemplate within themselves, these powers are 
subject to other influences arising from the force of good. This warmth and 
strength of prophecy invests us with its influence as the sun's rays affect 
both animate and inanimate entities. 

We human beings cannot through our natural consciousness and intelligence 
know anything of God the Creator's hidden secrets,  For it is not for us to 
know the times or the instants, etc.  

So much so that persons of future times may be seen in present ones, because 
God Almighty has wished to reveal them by means of images, together with 
various secrets of the future vouchsafed to orthodox astrology, as was the 
case in the past, so that a measure of power and divination passed through 
them, the flame of the spirit inspiring them to pronounce upon inspiration 
both human and divine. God may bring into being divine works, which are 
absolute; there is another level, that of angelic works; and a third way, 
that of the evildoers. 

But my son, I address you here a little too obscurely. As regards the occult 
prophecies one is vouchsafed through the subtle spirit of fire, which the 
understanding sometimes stirs through contemplation of the distant stars as 
if in vigil, likewise by means of pronouncements, one finds oneself surprised 
at producing writings without fear of being stricken for such impudent 
loquacity. The reason is that all this proceeds from the divine power of 
Almighty God from whom all bounty proceeds. 

And so once again, my son, if I have eschewed the word prophet, I do not wish 
to attribute to myself such lofty title at the present time, for whoever is 
called a prophet now was once called a seer; since a prophet, my son, is 
properly speaking one who sees distant things through a natural knowledge of 
all creatures. And it can happen that the prophet bringing about the perfect 
light of prophecy may make manifest things both human and divine, because 
this cannot be done otherwise, given that the effects of predicting the 
future extend far off into time. 

God's mysteries are incomprehensible and the power to influence events is 
bound up with the great expanse of natural knowledge, having its nearest most 
immediate origin in free will and describing future events which cannot be 
understood simply through being revealed. Neither can they be grasped through 
men's interpretations nor through another mode of cognizance or occult power 
under the firmament, neither in the present nor in the total eternity to come 
But bringing about such an indivisible eternity through Herculean efforts, 
things are revealed by the planetary movements. 

I am not saying, my son - mark me well, here - that knowledge of such things 
cannot be implanted in your deficient mind, or that events in the distant 
future may not be within the understanding of any reasoning being. 
Nevertheless, if these things current or distant are brought to the awareness 
of this reasoning and intelligent being they will be neither too obscure nor 
too clearly revealed. 

Perfect knowledge of such things cannot be acquired without divine 
inspiration, given that all prophetic inspiration derives its initial origin 
from God Almighty, then from chance and nature. Since all these portents are 
produced impartially, prophecy comes to pass partly as predicted. For 
understanding created by the intellect cannot be acquired by means of the 
occult, only by the aid of the zodiac, bringing forth that small flame by 
whose light part of the future may be discerned. 

Also, my son, I beseech you not to exercise your mind upon such reveries and 
vanities as drain the body and incur the soul's perdition, and which trouble 
our feeble frames. Above all avoid the vanity of that most execrable magic 
formerly reproved by the Holy Scriptures - only excepting the use of official 
astrology. 

For by the latter, with the help of inspiration and divine revelation, and 
continual calculations, I have set down my prophecies in writing. Fearing 
lest this occult philosophy be condemned, I did not therefore wish to make 
known its dire import; also fearful that several books which had lain hidden 
for long centuries might be discovered, and of what might become of them, 
after reading them I presented them to Vulcan. And while he devoured them, 
the flame licking the air gave out such an unexpected light, clearer than 
that of an ordinary flame and resembling fire from some flashing cataclysm, 
and suddenly illumined the house as if it were caught in a furnace. Which is 
why I reduced them to ashes then, so that none might be tempted to use occult 
labours in searching for the perfect transmutation, whether lunar or solar, 
of incorruptible metals. 

But as to that discernment which can be achieved by the aid of planetary 
scrutiny, I should like to tell you this. Eschewing any fantastic imaginings, 
you may through good judgement have insight into the future if you keep to 
the specific names of places that accord with planetary configurations, and 
with inspiration places and aspects yield up hidden properties, namely that 
power in whose presence the three times are understood as Eternity whose 
unfolding contains them all: for all things are naked and open.  

That is why, my son, you can easily, despite your young brain, understand 
that events can be foretold naturally by the heavenly bodies and by the 
spirit of prophecy: I do not wish to ascribe to myself the title and role of 
prophet, but emphasize inspiration revealed to a mortal man whose perception 
is no further from heaven than the feet are from the earth.  I cannot fail, 
err or be deceived, although I may be as great a sinner as anyone else upon 
this earth and subject to all human afflictions. 

But after being surprised sometimes by day while in a trance, and having long 
fallen into the habit of agreeable nocturnal studies, I have composed books 
of prophecies, each containing one hundred astronomical quatrains, which I 
want to condense somewhat obscurely. The work comprises prophecies from today 
to the year 3797. 

This may perturb some, when they see such a long timespan, and this will 
occur and be understood in all the fullness of the Republic; these things 
will be universally understood upon earth, my son. If you live the normal 
lifetime of man you will know upon your own soil, under your native sky, 
how future events are to turn out.  

For only Eternal God knows the eternity of His light which proceeds from Him, 
and I speak frankly to those to whom His immeasurable, immense and 
incomprehensible greatness has been disposed to grant revelations through 
long, melancholy inspiration, that with the aid of this hidden element 
manifested by God, there are two principal factors which make up the 
prophet's intelligence.  

The first is when the supernatural light fills and illuminates the person who 
predicts by astral science, while the second allows him to prophesy through 
inspired revelation, which is only a part of the divine eternity, whereby the 
prophet comes to assess what his divinatory power has given him through the 
grace of God and by a natural gift, namely, that what is foretold is true and 
ethereal in origin.  

And such a light and small flame is of great efficacy and scope, and nothing 
less than the clarity of nature itself. The light of human nature makes the 
philosophers so sure of themselves that with the principles of the first 
cause they reach the loftiest doctrines and the deepest abysses. 

But my son, lest I venture too far for your future perception, be aware that 
men of letters shall make grand and usually boastful claims about the way I 
interpreted the world, before the worldwide conflagration which is to bring 
so many catastrophes and such revolutions that scarcely any lands will not be 
covered by water, and this will last until all has perished save history 
and geography themselves. This is why, before and after these revolutions in 
various countries, the rains will be so diminished and such abundance of fire 
and fiery missiles shall fall from the heavens that nothing shall escape the 
holocaust. And this will occur before the last conflagration.  

For before war ends the century and in its final stages it will hold the 
century under its sway. Some countries will be in the grip of revolution for 
several years, and others ruined for a still longer period. And now that we 
are in a republican era, with Almighty God's aid, and before completing its 
full cycle, the monarchy will return, then the Golden Age. For according to 
the celestial signs, the Golden Age shall return, and after all calculations, 
with the world near to an all-encompassing revolution - from the time of 
writing 177 years 3 months 11 days - plague, long famine and wars, and still 
more floods from now until the stated time. Before and after these, humanity 
shall several times be so severely diminished that scarcely anyone shall be 
found who wishes to take over the fields, which shall become free where they 
had previously been tied.  

This will be after the visible judgement of heaven, before we reach the 
millennium which shall complete all. In the firmament of the eighth sphere, 
a dimension whereon Almighty God will complete the revolution, and where the 
constellations will resume their motion which will render the earth stable 
and firm, but only if He will remain unchanged for ever until His will be 
done.  

This is in spite of all the ambiguous opinions surpassing all natural reason, 
expressed by Mahomet; which is why God the Creator, through the ministry of  
his fiery agents with their flames, will come to propose to our perceptions  
as well as our eyes the reasons for future predictions.  

Signs of events to come must be manifested to whomever prophesies. For  
prophecy which stems from exterior illumination is part of that light and  
seeks to ally with it and bring it into being so that the part which seems to 
possess the faculty of understanding is not subject to a sickness of the mind.  

Reason is only too evident. Everything is predicted by divine afflatus and  
thanks to an angelic spirit inspiring the one prophesying, consecrating his  
predictions through divine unction. It also divests him of all fantasies by  
means of various nocturnal apparitions, while with daily certainty he  
prophesies through the science of astronomy, with the aid of sacred prophecy,  
his only consideration being his courage in freedom.  

So come, my son, strive to understand what I have found out through my  
calculations which accord with revealed inspiration, because now the sword  
of death approaches us, with pestilence and war more horrible than there has  
ever been - because of three men's work - and famine. And this sword shall  
smite the earth and return to it often, for the stars confirm this upheaval  
and it is also written: "I shall punish their injustices with iron rods, and  
shall strike them with blows." 

For God's mercy will be poured forth only for a certain time, my son, 
until the majority of my prophecies are fulfilled and this fulfillment is  
complete. Then several times in the course of the doleful tempests the Lord  
shall say: Therefore I shall crush and destroy and show no mercy; and many  
other circumstances shall result from floods and continual rain of which I  
have written more fully in my other prophecies, composed at some length, not  
in a chronological sequence, in prose, limiting the places and times and  
exact dates so that future generations will see, while experiencing these  
inevitable events, how I have listed others in clearer language, so that  
despite their obscurities these things shall be understood: When the time  
comes for the removal of ignorance, the matter will be clearer still.  

So in conclusion, my son, take this gift from your father M. Nostradamus,  
who hopes you will understand each prophecy in every quatrain herein. May  
Immortal God grant you a long life of good and prosperous happiness.  

Salon, 1 March 1555

Sitting alone at night in secret study;

quickly raised from low to high estate.

The great Empire will soon be exchanged 
for a small place, which soon will begin to grow.
A small place of tiny area 
in the middle of which he will come to lay down his scepter.

For as the moon is thus led by its angel

An agreement broken: lifting the face to heaven:
the bloody mouth will swim with blood;
the face anointed with milk and honey lies on the ground.

will make the Swiss break their important agreement.


Alas! what a great loss there will be to learning
before the cycle of the Moon is completed.
Fire, great floods, by more ignorant rulers;
how long the centuries until it is seen to be restored.


Pestilences extinguished, the world becomes smaller,
for a long time the lands will be inhabited peacefully.
People will travel safely through the sky (over) land and seas:
then wars will start up again.


At night they will think they have seen the sun,
when the see the half pig man:
Noise, screams, battles seen fought in the skies.
The brute beasts will be heard to speak.


A child without hands, never so great a thunderbolt seen,
the royal child wounded at a game of tennis.
At the well lightning strikes, joining together 
three trussed up in the middle under the oaks.


He who then carries the news,
after a short while will (stop) to breathe:
Viviers, Tournon, Montferrand and Praddelles;
hail and storms will make them grieve.


The great famine which I sense approaching
will often turn (in various areas) then become worldwide.
It will be so vast and long lasting that (they) will grab

A promontory stands between two seas:
A man who will die later by the bit of a horse;
Neptune unfurls a black sail for his man;
the fleet near Gibraltar and Rocheval.


To an old leader will be born an idiot heir,
weak both in knowledge and in war.
The leader of France is feared by his sister,
battlefields divided, conceded to the soldiers.


Bazas, Lectoure, Condom, Auch and Agen
are troubled by laws, disputes and monopolies.
Carcassone, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Bayonne will be ruined
when they wish to renew the massacre.


From the sixth bright celestial light 
it will come to thunder very strongly in Burgundy.
Then a monster will be born of a very hideous beast:
In March, April, May and June great wounding and worrying.


Nine will be set apart from the human flock,
separated from judgment and advise.
Their fate is to be divided as they depart.
K. Th. L. dead, banished and scattered.


When the great wooden columns tremble 
in the south wind, covered with blood.
Such a great assembly then pours forth
that Vienna and the land of Austria will tremble.


The alien nation will divide the spoils.
Saturn in dreadful aspect in Mars.
Dreadful and foreign to the Tuscans and Latins,
Greeks who will wish to strike.

Earthshaking fire from the center of the earth
will cause tremors around the New City.
Two great rocks will war for a long time,
then Arethusa will redden a new river.


The divine wrath overtakes the great Prince,
a short while before he will marry.

Counsel, he will die because of the shaven heads.


Those of Lerida will be in the Moselle,
kill all those from the Loire and Seine.
The seaside track will come near the high valley,
when the Spanish open every route.


Bordeaux and Poitiers at the sound of the bell
will go with a great fleet as fast as Langon.
A great rage will surge up against the French,
when a hideous monster is born near Orgon.


The Gods will make it appear to mankind
that they are the authors of a great war.
Before the sky was seen to bee free of weapons and rockets:
the greatest damage will be inflicted on the left.

but not long after will be looting and rebellion.
Because of a refusal, town, land and see will be broached.
About a third of a million dead or captured.

from the illustrious and ancient line of a monk.
His fame, renown and power through sects and speech
is such that they will say the living twin is deservedly chosen.


A man will be charged with the destruction 
of temples and sects, altered by fantasy.
He will harm the rocks rather than the living,

The captain will lead a great herd
on the mountain closest to the enemy.
Surrounded by fire he makes such a way,
all escape except for thirty put on the spit.


The great one of Alba will come to rebel,
he will betray his great forebears.
The great man of Guise will come to vanquish him,
led captive with a monument erected.


The sack approaches, fire and great bloodshed.
Po the great rivers, the enterprise for the clowns;
after a long wait from Genoa and Nice,
Fossano, Turin the capture at Savigliano.


From Languedoc and Guienne more than ten
thousand will want to cross the Alps again.
The great Savoyards march against Brindisi,
Aquino and Bresse will come to drive them back.


From the bank of Montereale will be born one 
who bores and calculates becoming a tyrant.
To raise a force in the marches of Milan,
to drain Faenza and Florence of gold and men


The kingdom stripped of its forces by fraud,
the fleet blockaded, passages for the spy;
two false friends will come to rally 
to awaken hatred for a long time dormant.


The French nation will be in great grief,
vain and lighthearted, they will believe rash things.
No bread, salt, wine nor water, venom nor ale,
the greater one captured, hunger, cold and want.


The great fish will come to complain and weep
for having chosen, deceived concerning his age:
he will hardly want to remain with them,
he will be deceived by those (speaking) his own tongue.


God, the heavens, all the divine words in the waves,
carried by seven red-shaven heads to Byzantium:
against the anointed three hundred from Trebizond,
will make two laws, first horror then trust.


Ten sent to put the captain of the ship to death,
are altered by one that there is open revolt in the fleet.
Confusion, the leader and another stab and bite each other
at Lerins and the Hyerès, ships, prow into the darkness.


The elder royal one on a frisky horse
will spur so fiercely that it will bolt.
Mouth, mouthful, foot complaining in the embrace;
dragged, pulled, to die horribly.


The leader of the French army
will expect to lose the main phalanx.
Upon the pavement of oats and slate
the foreign nation will be undermined through Genoa.


Within casks anointed outside with oil and grease
twenty-one will be shut before the harbor,
at second watch; through death they will do great deeds;
to win the gates and be killed by the watch.


The bones of the feet and the hands locked up,
because of the noise the house is uninhabited for a long time.
Digging in dreams they will be unearthed,
the house healthy in inhabited without noise.


Two newly arrived have seized the poison,
to pour it in the kitchen of the great Prince.
By the scullion both are caught in the act,
taken he who thought to trouble the elder with death.
TO THE MOST INVINCIBLE 
MOST POWERFUL AND MOST CHRISTIAN 
HENRY, KING OF FRANCE THE SECOND: 
MICHEL NOSTRADAMUS, 
HIS VERY HUMBLE AND VERY OBEDIENT SERVANT AND SUBJECT, 
WISHES VICTORY AND HAPPINESS 

Ever since my long-beclouded face first presented itself before the  
immeasurable deity of your Majesty, O Most Christian and Most Victorious King, 
I have remained perpetually dazzled by that sovereign sight. I have never 
ceased to honor and venerate properly that date when I presented myself  
before a Majesty so singular and so humane. I have searched for some occasion 
on which to manifest high heart and stout courage, and thereby obtain even  
greater recognition of Your Most Serene Majesty. But I saw how obviously  
impossible it was for me to declare myself. 

While I was seized with this singular desire to be transported suddenly from  
my long-beclouded obscurity to the illuminating presence of the first monarch  
of the universe, I was also long in doubt as to whom I would dedicate these  
last three Centuries of my prophecies, making up the thousand. After having  
meditated for a long time on an act of such rash audacity, I have ventured to  
address Your Majesty. I have not been daunted like those mentioned by that  
most grave author Plutarch, in his Life of Lycurgus, who were so astounded at  
the expense of the offerings and gifts brought as sacrifices to the temples  
of the immortal gods of that age, that they did not dare to present anything  
at all. Seeing your royal splendor to be accompanied by such an incomparable  
humanity, I have paid my address to it and not as those Kings of Persia whom  
one could neither stand before nor approach. 

It is to a most prudent and most wise Prince that I have dedicated my  
nocturnal and prophetic calculations, which are composed rather out of a  
natural instinct, accompanied by a poetic furor, than according to the strict  
rules of poetry. Most of them have been integrated with astronomical  
calculations corresponding to the years, months and weeks of the regions,  
countries and most of the towns and cities of all Europe, including Africa  
and part of Asia, where most of all these coming events are to transpire.  
They are composed in a natural manner. 

Indeed, someone, who would do well to blow his nose, may reply that the  
rhythm is as easy as the sense is difficult. That, O Most Humane king, is  
because most of the prophetic quatrains are so ticklish that there is no  
making way through them, nor is there any interpreting of them. 

Nevertheless, I wanted to leave a record in writing of the years, towns,  
cities and regions in which most of the events will come to pass, even those  
of the year 1585 and of the year 1606, reckoning from the present time, which  
is March 14, 1557, and going far beyond to the events which will take place  
at the beginning of the seventh millenary, when, so far as my profound  
astronomical calculations and other knowledge have been able to make out,  
the adversaries of Jesus Christ and his Church will begin to multiply greatly. 

I have calculated and composed all during choice hours of well-disposed days,  
and as accurately as I could, all when Minerva was free and not unfavorable.  
I have made computations for events over almost as long a period to come as  
that which has already passed, and by these they will know in all regions  
what is to happen in the course of time, just as it is written, with  
nothing superfluous added, although some may say, There can be no truth  
entirely determined concerning the future.  

It is quite true, Sire, that my natural instinct has been inherited from my  
forebears, who did not believe in predicting, and that this is natural  
instinct has been adjusted and integrated with long calculations. At the same  
time, I freed my soul, mind and heart of all care, solicitude and vexation.  
All of these prerequisites for presaging I achieved in part by means of the  
brazen tripod.  

There are some who would attribute to me that which is not mine at all. The  
eternal God alone, who is the thorough searcher of humane hearts, pious, just  
and merciful, is the true judge, and it is to him I pray to defend me from  
the calumny of evil men. These evil ones, in their slanderous way, would  
likewise want to inquire how all your most ancient progenitors, the Kings of  
France, have cured the scrofula, how those of other nations have cured the  
bite of snakes, how those of yet other nations have had a certain instinct  
for the art of divination and still others which would be too long to recite  
here. 

Notwithstanding those who cannot contain the malignity of the evil spirit, as  
time elapses after my death, my writings will have more weight than during my  
lifetime. Should I, however, have made any errors in my calculation of dates,  
or prove unable to please everybody, I beg that your more than Imperial  
Majesty will forgive me. I protest before God and his Saints that I do not  
propose to insert any writings in this present Epistle that will be contrary  
to the true Catholic faith, whilst consulting the astronomical calculations  
to the best of my ability. 

Such is the extent of time past, subject to correction by the most learned  
judgment, that the first man, Adam, came 1,242 years before Noah (not  
reckoning by such Gentile calculations as Varro used, but simply by the Holy  
Scriptures, as best my weak understanding and astronomical calculations can  
interpret them.) About 1,080 years after Noah and the universal flood came  
Abraham, who, according to some, was a first-rate astrologer and invented the  
Chaldean alphabet. About 515 or 516 years later came Moses, and from his time  
to that of David about 570 years elapsed. From the time of David to that of  
out Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, born of the unique Virgin, 1,350 year  
elapsed, according to some chronographs. Some may object that this  
calculation cannot be true, because it differs from that of Eusebius. From  
the time of the human redemption to the detestable heresy of the Saracens  
about 621 years elapsed. From this one can easily add up the amount of time  
gone by. 

Although my calculations may not hold good for all nations, they have,  
however, been determined by the celestial movements, combined with the  
emotion, handed down to me by my forebears, which comes over me at certain  
hours. But the danger of the times, O Most Serene King, requires that such  
secrets should not be bared except in enigmatic sentences having, however,  
only one sense and meaning, and nothing ambiguous or amphibological inserted.  
Rather they are under a cloudy obscurity, with a natural infusion not unlike  
the creation of the world, according to the calculation and Punic Chronicle  
of Joel: I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters  
will prophesy. But such Prophecy proceeded from the mouth of the Holy Ghost  
who was the sovereign and eternal power, together with the heavens, and  
caused some of them to predict great and marvelous events. 

As for myself, I would never claim such a title, never, please God. I readily  
admit that all proceeds from God and render to Him thanks, honor and immortal  
praise. I have mixed therewith no divination coming from fate. All from God  
and nature, and for the most part integrated with celestial movements. It is  
much like seeing in a burning mirror, with clouded vision, the great events,  
sad, prodigious and calamitous events that in due time will fall upon the  
principal worshippers. First, upon the temples of God; secondly, upon those  
who, sustained by the earth, approach such a decadence. Also a thousand other  
calamitous events which will be known to happen in due time. 

For God will take notice of the long barrenness of the great dame, who  
thereupon will conceive two principal children. But she will be in danger,  
and the female to whom she will have given birth will also, because of the  
temerity of the age, be in danger of death in her eighteenth year, and will  
be unable to live beyond her thirty-sixth year. She will leave three males,  
and one female, and of these two will not have had the same father. 

There will be great differences between the three brothers, and then there  
will be such great cooperation and agreement between them that the three and  
four parts of Europe will tremble. The youngest of them will sustain and  
augment the Christian monarchy, and under him sects will be elevated, and  
suddenly cast down, Arabs will be driven back, kingdoms united and new laws  
promulgated. 

The oldest one will rule the land whose escutcheon is that of the furious  
crowned lions with their paws resting upon intrepid arms. 

The one second in age, accompanied by the Latins, will penetrate far, until  
a second furious and trembling path has been beaten to the Great St. Bernard  
Pass. From there he will descend to mount the Pyrenees, which will not,  
however, be transferred to the French crown. And this third one will cause a  
great inundation of human blood, and for a long time Lent will not include  
March. 

The daughter will be given for the preservation of the Christian Church. Her  
lord will fall into the pagan sect of the new infidels. Of her two children,  
one will be faithful to the Catholic Church, the other an infidel. 

The unfaithful son, who, to his great confusion and later repentance, will  
want to ruin her, will have three widely scattered regions, namely, the Roman, 
Germany and Spain, which will set up diverse sects by armed force. The 50th  
to the 52th degree of latitude will be left behind. 

And all will render the homage of ancient religions to the region of Europe  
north of the 48th parallel. The latter will have trembled first in vain  
timidity but afterwards the regions to its west, south and east will tremble.  
But the nature of their power will be such that what has been brought about  
by concord and union will prove insuperable by warlike conquests. 

In nature they will be equal, but very different in faith. 

After this the barren Dame, of greater power than the second, will be  
received by two of the nations. First, by them made obstinate by the onetime  
masters of the universe. Second, by the latter themselves. 

The third people will extend their forces towards the circuit of the East of  
Europe where, in the Pannonias, they will be overwhelmed and slaughtered. By  
sea they will extend their Myrmidons and Germans to Adriatic Sicily. But they  
will succumb wholly and the Barbarian sect will be greatly afflicted and  
driven out by all the Latins. 

Then the great Empire of the Antichrist will begin where once was Attila's  
empire and the new Xerxes will descend with great and countless numbers, so  
that the coming of the Holy Ghost, proceeding from the 48th degree, will make  
a transmigration, chasing out the abomination of the Christian Church, and  
whose reign will be for a time and to the end of time.  

This will be preceded by a solar eclipse more dark and gloomy than any since  
the creation of the world, except that after the death and passion of Jesus  
Christ. And it will be in the month of October than the great translation  
will be made and it will be such that one will think the gravity of the earth  
has lost its natural movement and that it is to be plunged into the abyss of  
perpetual darkness. 

In the spring there will be omens, and thereafter extreme changes, reversals  
of realms and mighty earthquakes. These will be accompanied by the  
procreation of the new Babylon, miserable daughter enlarged by the  
abomination of the first holocaust. It will last for only seventy-three  
years and seven months. 

Then there will issue from the stock which had remained barren for so long,  
proceeding from the 50th degree, one who will renew the whole Christian  
Church. A great place will be established, with union and concord between  
some of the children of opposite ideas, who have been separated by diverse  
realms. And such will be the peace that the instigator and promoter of  
military factions, born of the diversity of religions, will remain chained to  
the deepest pit. And the kingdom of the Furious One, who counterfeits the  
sage, will be united. 

The countries, towns, cities, realms and provinces which will have abandoned  
their old customs to gain liberty, but which will in fact have enthralled  
themselves even more, will secretly have wearied of their liberty. Faith lost  
in their perfect religion, they will begin to strike to the left, only to  
return to the right. Holiness, for a long time overcome, will be replaced in  
accordance with the earliest writings. 

Thereafter the great dog, the biggest of curs, will go forth and destroy all, 
the same old crimes being perpetrated again. Temples will be set up again as  
in ancient times, and the priest will be restored to his original position  
and he will begin his whoring and luxury, and will commit a thousand crimes. 

At the eve of another desolation, when she is atop her most high and sublime  
dignity, some potentates and warlords will confront her, and take away her  
two swords, and leave her only the insignia, whose curvature attracts them.  
The people will make him go to the right and will not wish to submit  
themselves to those of the opposite extreme with the hand in acute position,  
who touch the ground, and want to drive spurs into them. 

The people of the world from this benevolent slavery to which they had  
voluntary submitted. He will put himself under the protection of Mars,  
stripping Jupiter of all his honors and dignities, and establish himself  
in the free city in another scant Mesopotamia. The chief and governor will  
be cast out from the middle and hung up, ignorant of the conspiracy of one  
of the conspirators with the second Thrasibulus, who for a long time will  
have directed all this. 

Then the impurities and abominations, with a great shame, will be brought  
out and manifested in the shadows of the veiled light, and will cease towards  
the end of the change in reign. The chiefs of the Church will be backward in  
the love of God, and several of them will apostatize from the true faith. Of  
the three sects, that which is in the middle, because of its own partisans,  
will be thrown a bit into decadence. The first one will be exterminated  
throughout all Europe and most of Africa by the third one, making use of the  
poor in spirit who, led by madmen to libidinous luxury, will adulterate. 

The supporting common people will rise up and chase out the adherents of the  
legislators. From the way realms will have been weakened by the Easterners,  
it will seem that God the Creator has loosed Satan from the prisons of hell  
to give birth to the great Dog and Dogam, who will make such an abominable  
breach in the Churches that neither the reds nor the whites without eyes or  
hands will know what to make of it, and their power will be taken from them. 

Then will commence a persecution of the Churches the like of which was never  
seen. Meanwhile, such a plague will arise that more than two thirds of the  
world will be removed. One will be unable to ascertain the true owners of  
fields and houses, and weeds growing in the streets of cities will rise  
higher than the knees. For the clergy there will be but utter desolation. The  
warlords will usurp what is returned from the City of the Sun, from Malta and  
the Isles of Hyhres. The great chain of the port which wakes its name from  
the marine ox will be opened. 

And a new incursion will be made by the maritime shores, wishing to deliver  
the Sierra Morea from the first Mahometan recapture. Their assaults will not  
all be in vain, and the place which was once the abode of Abraham will be  
assaulted by persons who hold the Jovialists in veneration. And this city of  
"Achem" will be surrounded and assailed on all sides by a most powerful force 
of warriors. Their maritime forces will be weakened by the Westerners, and  
great desolation will fall upon this realm. Its greatest cities will be  
depopulated and those who enter will fall under the vengeance of the wrath  
of God. 

The sepulcher, for long an object of such great veneration, will remain in  
the open, exposed to the sight of the heavens, the Sun and the Moon. The holy  
place will be converted into a stable for a herd large and small, and used  
for profane purposes. Oh, what a calamitous affliction will pregnant women  
bear at this time. 

For hereupon the principal Eastern chief will be vanquished by the  
Northerners and Westerners, and most of his people, stirred up, will be put  
to death, overwhelmed or scattered. His children, offspring of many women,  
will be imprisoned. Then will be accomplished the prophecy of the Royal  
Prophet, Let him hear the groaning of the captives, that he might deliver the  
children of those doomed to die.  

What great oppression will then fall upon the Princes and Governors of  
Kingdoms, especially those which will be maritime and Eastern, whose tongues  
will be intermingled with all others: the tongue of the Latins, and of the  
Arabs, via the Phoenicians. And all these Eastern Kings will be chased,  
overthrown and exterminated, but not altogether, by means of the forces of  
the Kings of the North, and because of the drawing near of our age through  
the three secretly united in the search for death, treacherously laying traps  
for one another. This renewed Triumvirate will last for seven years, and the  
renown of this sect will extend around the world. The sacrifice of the hole  
and immaculate Wafer will be sustained. 

Then the Lords of "Aquilon" [the North], two in number, will be victorious  
over the Easterners, and so great a noise and bellicose tumult will they  
make amongst them that all the East will tremble in terror of these brothers, 
yet not brothers, of "Aquilon" [the North]. 

By this discourse, Sire, I present these predictions almost with confusion,  
especially as to when they will take place. Furthermore, the chronology of  
time which follows conforms very little, if at all, with that which has  
already been set forth. Yet it was determined by astronomy and other sources,  
including Holy Scriptures, and thus could not err. If I had wanted to date  
each quatrain, I could have done so. But this would not have been agreeable  
to all, least of all to those interpreting them, and was not to be done until  
Your Majesty granted me full power to do so, lest calumniators be furnished  
with an opportunity to injure me. 

Anyhow, I count the years from the creation of the world to the birth of Noah  
as 1,506, and from the birth of Noah to the completion of the Ark, at the  
time of the universal deluge, as 600 (let the years be solar, or lunar, or a  
mixture of the ten) I hold that the Sacred Scriptures use solar years. And  
at the end of these 600 years, Noah entered the Ark to be saved from the  
deluge. This deluge was universal, and lasted one year and two months. And  
295 years elapsed from the end of the flood to the birth of Abraham, and 100  
from then till the birth of Isaac. And 60 years later Jacob was born. 130  
years elapsed between the time he entered Egypt and the time he came out.  
Between the entry of Jacob into Egypt and the exodus, 430 years passed. From  
the exodus to the building of the Temple by Solomon in the fourth year of  
his reign, 480 years. According to the calculations of the Sacred Writings,  
it was 490 years from the building of the Temple to the time of Jesus Christ.  
Thus, this calculation of mine, collected from the holy writ, comes to about  
4,173 years and 8 months, more or less. Because there is such a diversity of  
sects, I will not go beyond Jesus Christ. 

I have calculated the present prophecies according to the order of the chain  
which contains its revolution, all by astronomical doctrine modified by my  
natural instinct. After a while, I found the time when Saturn turns to enter  
on April 7 till August 25, Jupiter on June 14 till October 7, Mars from April  
17 to June 22, Venus from April 9 to May 22, Mercury from February 3 to  
February 24. After that, from June 1 to June 24, and from September 25 to  
October 16, Saturn in Capricorn, Jupiter in Aquarius, Mars in Scorpio, Venus  
in Pisces, Mercury for a month in Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces, the Moon  
in Aquarius, the Dragon's head in Libra: its tail in opposition following a  
conjunction of Jupiter and Mercury with a quadrature of Mars and Mercury,  
and the Dragon's head coinciding with a conjunction of the Sun and Jupiter.  
And the year without an eclipse peaceful. 

But not everywhere. It will mark the commencement of what will long endure.  
For beginning with this year the Christian Church will be persecuted more  
fiercely than it ever was in Africa, and this will last up to the year 1792,  
which they will believe to mark a renewal of time. 

After this the Roman people will begin to re-establish themselves, chasing  
away some obscure shadows and recovering a bit of their ancient glory. But  
this will not be without great division and continual changes. Thereafter  
Venice will raise its wings very high in great force and power, not far  
short of the might of ancient Rome. 

At that time the great sails of Byzantium, allied with the Ligurians and  
through the support and power of "Aquilon" [the Northern Realm], will impede  
them so greatly that the two Cretans will be unable to maintain their faith.  
The arks built by the Warriors of ancient times will accompany them to the  
waves of Neptune. In the Adriatic great discord will arise, and that which  
will have been united will be separated. To a house will be reduced that  
which was, and is, a great city, including "Pampotamia" and "Mesopotamia" of  
Europe at 45, and others of 41, 42 and 37 degrees. 

It will be at this time and in these countries that the infernal power will  
set the power of its adversaries against the Church of Jesus Christ. This  
will constitute of the second Antichrist, who will persecute that Church and  
its true Vicar, by means of the power of three temporal kings who in their  
ignorance will be seduced by tongues which, in the hands of the madmen, will  
cut more than any sword. 

The said reign of the Antichrist will last only to the death of him who was  
born at the beginning of the age and of the other one of Lyon, associated  
with the elected one of the House of Modena and of Ferrara, maintained by  
the Adriatic Ligurians and the proximity of great Sicily. Then the Great St.  
Bernard will be passed. 

The Gallic Ogmios will be accompanied by so great a number that the Empire  
of his great law will extend very far. For some time thereafter the blood of  
the Innocent will be shed profusely by the recently elevated guilty ones.  
Then, because of great floods, the memory of things contained in these  
instruments will suffer incalculable loss, even letters. This will happen to  
the "Aquiloners" [the Northern People] by the will of God. 

Once again Satan will be bound, universal peace will be established among  
men, and the Church of Jesus Christ will be delivered from all tribulations,  
although the Philistines would like to mix in the honey of malice and their  
pestilent seduction. This will be near the seventh millenary, when the  
sanctuary of Jesus Christ will no longer be trodden down by the infidels  
who come from "Aquilon" [the North]. The world will be approaching a great  
conflagration, although, according to my calculations in my prophecies, the  
course of time runs much further. 

In the Epistle that some years ago I dedicated to my son, Cisar Nostradamus,  
I declared some points openly enough, without presage. But here, Sire, are  
included several great and marvelous events which those to come after will  
see. 

During this astrological supputation, harmonized with the Holy Scriptures,  
the persecution of the Ecclesiastical folk will have its origin in the power  
of the Kings of "Aquilon" [the North], united with the Easterners. This  
persecution will last for eleven years, or somewhat less, for then the chief  
King of "Aquilon" will fall. 

Thereupon the same thing will occur in the South, where for the space of  
three years the Church people will be persecuted even more fiercely through  
the Apostatic seduction of one who will hold all the absolute power in the  
Church militant. The hole people of God, the observer of his law, will be  
persecuted fiercely and such will be their affliction that the blood of the  
true Ecclesiastics will flow everywhere. 

One of the horrible temporal Kings will be told by his adherents, as the  
ultimate in praise, that he has shed more of human blood of Innocent  
Ecclesiastics than anyone else could have spilled of wine. This King will  
commit incredible crimes against the Church. Human blood will flow in the  
public streets and temples, like water after an impetuous rain, coloring the  
nearby rivers red with blood. The ocean itself will be reddened by another  
naval battle, such that one king will say to another, Naval battles have  
caused the sea to blush.  

Then, in this same year, and in those following, there will ensue the most  
horrible pestilence, made more stupendous by the famine which will have  
preceded it. Such great tribulations will never have occurred since the  
first foundation of the Christian Church. It will cover all Latin regions,  
and will leave traces in some countries of the Spanish. 

Thereupon the third King of "Aquilon" [the North], hearing the lament of the  
people of his principal title, will raise a very mighty army and, defying  
the tradition of his predecessors, will put almost everything back in its  
proper place, and the great Vicar of the hood will be put back in his former  
state. But desolated, and then abandoned by all, he will turn to find the  
Holy of Holies destroyed by paganism, and the old and new Testaments thrown  
out and burned. 

After that Antichrist will be the infernal prince again, for the last time.  
All the Kingdoms of Christianity will tremble, even those of the infidels,  
for the space of twenty-five years. Wars and battles will be more grievous  
and towns, cities, castles and all other edifices will be burned, desolated  
and destroyed, with great effusion of vestal blood, violations of married  
woman and widows, and sucking children dashed and broken against the walls  
of towns. By means of Satan, Prince Infernal, so may evils will be committed  
that nearly all the world will find itself undone and desolated. Before  
these events, some rare birds will cry in the air: Hui, Hui [Today, today]  
and some time later will vanish. 

After this has endured for a long time, there will be almost renewed another  
reign of Saturn, and golden age. Hearing the affliction of his people, God  
the Creator will command that Satan be cast into the depths of the bottomless  
pit, and bound there. Then a universal peace will commence between God and  
man, and Satan will remain bound for around a thousand years, and then all  
unbound. 

All these figures represent the just integration of Holy Scriptures with  
visible celestial bodies, namely, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and others conjoined,  
as can be seen at more length in some of the quatrains. I would have  
calculated more profoundly and integrated them even further, Most Serene  
King, but for the fact that some given to censure would raise difficulties.  
Therefore I withdraw my pen and seek nocturnal repose. 

Many events, most powerful of all Kings, of the most astounding sort are to  
transpire soon, but I neither could nor would fit them all into this epistle; 
but in order to comprehend certain horrible facts, a few must be set forth.  
So great is your grandeur and humanity before men, and your piety before the  
gods, that you alone seem worthy of the great title of the Most Christian  
King, and to whom the highest authority in all religion should be deferred.  

But I shall only beseech you, Most Clement King, by this singular and prudent 
humanity of yours, to understand rather the desire of my heart, and the  
sovereign wish I have to obey Your Most Serene Majesty, ever since my eyes  
approached your solar splendor, than the grandeur of my labor can attain to

Again will the holy temples be polluted,
And plundered by the Senate of Toulouse:
Saturn two three cycles completed,
In April, May, people of new leaven.


The Blue Turban King entered into Foix,
And he will reign less than an evolution of Saturn:
The White Turban King Byzantium heart banished,
Sun, Mars and Mercury near Aquarius.


In the city of Fertsod homicide,
Deed, and deed many oxen plowing no sacrifice:
Return again to the honors of Artemis,
And to Vulcan bodies dead ones to bury.


From Ambracia and the country of Thrace
People by sea, evil and help from the Gauls:
In Provence the perpetual trace,
With vestiges of their custom and laws.


With the rapacious and blood-thirsty king,
Issued from the pallet of the inhuman Nero:
Between two rivers military hand left,
He will be murdered by Young Baldy.


The realm taken the King will conspire,
The lady taken to death ones sworn by lot:
They will refuse life to the Queen and son,
And the mistress at the fort of the wife.


The Greek lady of ugly beauty,
Made happy by countless suitors:
Transferred out to the Spanish realm,
Taken captive to die a miserable death.


The chief of the fleet through deceit and trickery
Will make the timid ones come out of their galleys:
Come out, murdered, the chief renouncer of chrism,
Then through ambush they will pay him his wages.


The Duke will want to exterminate his followers,
He will send the strongest ones to strange places:
Through tyranny to ruin Pisa and Lucca,
Then the Barbarians will gather the grapes without vine.


The crafty King will understand his snares,
Enemies to assail from three sides:
A strange number tears from hoods,
The grandeur of the translator will come to fail.


By the flood and fierce pestilence,
The great city for long besieged:
The sentry and guard dead by hand,
Sudden capture but none wronged.


Sun twentieth of Taurus the earth will tremble very mightily,
It will ruin the great theater filled:
To darken and trouble air, sky and land,
Then the infidel will call upon God and saints.


The King exposed will complete the slaughter,
After having discovered his origin:
Torrent to open the tomb of marble and lead,
Of a great Roman with Medusine device.


To pass Guienne, Languedoc and the Rhône,
From Agen holding Marmande and La Réole:
To open through faith the wall, Marseilles will hold its throne,
Conflict near Saint-Paul-de-Mausole.


From Bourg-la-Reine they will come straight to Chartres,
And near Pont d'Antony they will pause:
Seven crafty as Martens for peace,
Paris closed by an army they will enter.


In the forest cleared of the Tuft,
By the hermitage will be placed the temple:
The Duke of Étampes through the ruse he invented
Will teach a lesson to the prelate of Montlhéry.


Calais, Arras, help to Thérouanne,
Peace and semblance the spy will simulate:
The soldiery of Savoy to descend by Roanne,
People who would end the rout deterred.


For seven years fortune will favor Philip,
He will beat down again the exertions of the Arabs:
Then at his noon perplexing contrary affair,
Young Ogmios will destroy his stronghold.


A captain of Great Germany
Will come to deliver through false help
To the King of Kings the support of Pannonia,
So that his revolt will cause a great flow of blood.


The horrible plague Perinthus and Nicopolis,
The Peninsula and Macedonia will it fall upon:
It will devastate Thessaly and Amphipolis,
An unknown evil, and from Anthony refusal.


The King will want to enter the new city,
Through its enemies they will come to subdue it:
Captive free falsely to speak and act,
King to be outside, he will keep far from the enemy.


The enemies very far from the fort,
The bastion brought by wagons:
Above the walls of Bourges crumbled,
When Hercules the Macedonian will strike.


Weak galleys will be joined together,
False enemies the strongest on the rampart:
Weak ones assailed Bratislava trembles,
Lübeck and Meissen will take the barbarian side.


The newly made one will lead the army,
Almost cut off up to near the bank:
Help from the Milanais elite straining,
The Duke deprived of his eyes in Milan in an iron cage.


The army denied entry to the city,
The Duke will enter through persuasion:
The army led secretly to the weak gates,
They will put it to fire and sword, effusion of blood.


The forces of the sea divided into three parts,
The second one will run out of supplies,
In despair looking for the Elysian Fields,
The first ones to enter the breach will obtain the victory.


Those afflicted through the fault of a single one stained,
The transgressor in the opposite party:
He will send word to those of Lyons that compelled
They be to deliver the great chief of Molite.


The "Aquilon" Wind will cause the siege to be raised,
Over the walls to throw ashes, lime and dust:
Through rain afterwards, which will do them much worse,
Last help against their frontier.


Naval battle night will be overcome, 
Fire in the ships to the West ruin:
New trick, the great ship colored,
Anger to the vanquished, and victory in a drizzle.

To the enemy, the enemy faith promised
Will not be kept, the captives retained:
One near death captured, and the remainder in their shirts,
The remainder damned for being supported.


The ship's veil will hide the sail galley,
The great fleet will come the lesser one to go out:
Ten ships near will turn to drive it back,
The great one conquered the united ones to join to itself.


After that five will not put out the flock,
A fugitive for Penelon he will turn loose:
To murmur falsely then help to come,
The chief will then abandon the siege.


At midnight the leader of the army
Will save himself, suddenly vanished:
Seven years later his reputation unblemished,
To his return they will never say yes.


Albi and Castres will form a new league,
Nine Arians Lisbon and the Portuguese:
Carcassonne and Toulouse will end their intrigue,
When the chief new monster from the Lauraguais.


The Gardon will flood Nîmes so high
That they will believe Deucalion reborn:
Into the colossus the greater part will flee,
Vesta tomb fire to appear extinguished.


The great conflict that they are preparing for Nancy,
The Macedonian will say I subjugate all:
The British Isle in anxiety over wine and salt,
"Hem. mi." Philip two Metz will not hold for long.


With forefinger and thumb he will moisten the forehead,
The Count of Senigallia to his own son:
The Venus through several of thin forehead,
Three in seven days wounded dead.


In the Castle of Figueras on a misty day
A sovereign prince will be born of an infamous woman:
Surname of breeches on the ground will make him posthumous,
Never was there a King so very bad in his province.


Stained with murder and enormous adulteries,
Great enemy of the entire human race:
One who will be worse than his grandfathers, uncles or fathers,
In steel, fire, waters, bloody and inhuman.


At the dangerous passage below Junquera,
The posthumous one will have his band cross:
To pass the Pyrenees mountains without his baggage,
From Perpignan the duke will hasten to Tende.


Elected Pope, as elected he will be mocked,
Suddenly unexpectedly moved prompt and timid:
Through too much goodness and kindness provoked to die,
Fear extinguished guides the night of his death.


Beneath the food of ruminating animals,
led by them to the belly of the fodder city:
Soldiers hidden, their arms making a noise,
Tried not far from the city of Antibes.


Urnel Vaucile without a purpose on his own,
Bold, timid, through fear overcome and captured:
Accompanied by several pale whores,
Convinced in the Carthusian convent at Barcelona.


Father duke old in years and choked by thirst,
On his last day his don denying him the jug:
Into the well plunged alive he will come up dead,
Senate to the thread death long and light.


Happy in the realm of France, happy in life,
Ignorant of blood, death, fury and plunder:
For a flattering name he will be envied,
A concealed King, too much faith in the kitchen.


The convict Queen seeing her daughter pale,
Because of a sorrow locked up in her breast:
Lamentable cries will come then from Angoulême,
And the marriage of the first cousin impeded.


The house of Lorraine will make way for Vendôme,
The high put low, and the low put high:
The son of Mammon will be elected in Rome,
And the two great ones will be put at a loss.


The day that she will be hailed as Queen,
The day after the benediction the prayer:
The reckoning is right and valid,
Once humble never was one so proud.


All the friend who will have belonged to the party,
For the rude in letters put to death and plundered:
Property up for sale at fixed price the great one annihilated.
Never were the Roman people so wronged.


Through the spite of the King supporting the lesser one,
He will be murdered presenting the jewels to him:
The father wishing to impress nobility on the son
Does as the Magi did of yore in Persia.


For not wishing to consent to the divorce,
Which then afterwards will be recognized as unworthy:
The King of the Isles will be driven out by force,
In his place put one who will have no mark of a king.


The remonstrances made to the ungrateful people,
Thereupon the army will seize Antibes:
The complaints will place Monace in the arch,
And at Fréjus the one will take the shore from the other


The captive prince conquered in Italy
Will pass Genoa by sea as far as Marseilles:
Through great exertion by the foreigners overcome,
Safe from gunshot, barrel of bee's liquor.


Through the Ebro to open the passage of Bisanne,
Very far away will the Tagus make a demonstration:
In Pelligouxe will the outrage be committed,
By the great lady seated in the orchestra.


The successor will avenge his brother-in-law,
To occupy the realm under the shadow of vengeance:
Obstacle slain his blood for the death blame,
For a long time will Brittany hold with France.


Through the fifth one and a great Hercules
They will come to open the temple by hand of war:
One Clement, Julius and Ascanius set back,
The sword, key, eagle, never was there such a great animosity.


Second and third which make prime music
By the King to be sublimated in honor:
Through the fat and the thin almost emaciated,
By the false report of Venus to be debased.


In a cave of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole a goat
Hidden and seized pulled out by the beard:
Led captive like a mastiff beast
By the Bigorre people brought to near Tarbes.


Nephew and blood of the new saint come,
Through the surname he will sustain arches and roof:
They will be driven out put to death chased nude,
Into red and black will they convert their green.


The Holy Empire will come into Germany,
The Ishmaelites will find open places:
The asses will want also Carmania,
The supporters all covered by earth.


The great empire, everyone would be of it,
One will come to obtain it over the others:
But his realm and state will be of short duration,
Two years will he be able to maintain himself on the sea.


The cruel faction in the long robe
Will come to hide under the sharp daggers:
The Duke to seize Florence and the diphthong place,
Its discovery by immature ones and sycophants.


The Gaul who will hold the empire through war,
He will be betrayed by his minor brother-in-law:
He will be drawn by a fierce, prancing horse,
The brother will be hated for the deed for a long time


The younger son of the king flagrant in burning lust
To enjoy his first cousin:
Female attire in the Temple of Artemis,
Going to be murdered by the unknown one of Maine.


Upon the King of the stump speaking of wars,
The United Isle will hold him in contempt:
For several good years one gnawing and pillaging,
Through tyranny in the isle esteem changing.


The great assembly near the Lake of Bourget,
They will meet near Montmélian:
Going beyond the thoughtful ones will draw up a plan,
Chambéry, Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, Saint-Julien combat.


Sprightly love lays the siege not far,
The garrisons will be at the barbarian saint:
The Orsini and Adria will provide a guarantee for the Gauls,
For fear delivered by the army to the Grisons.


First son, widow, unfortunate marriage,
Without any children two Isles in discord:
Before eighteen, incompetent age,
For the other one the betrothal will take place while younger.


The young heir to the British realm,
Whom his dying father will have recommended:
The latter dead Lonole will dispute with him,
And from the son the realm demanded.


On the boundary of Caussade and Caylus,
Not at all far from the bottom of the valley:
Music from Villefranche to the sound of lutes,
Encompassed by cymbals and great stringing.


The humane realm of Anglican offspring,
It will cause its realm to hold to peace and union:
War half-captive in its enclosure,
For long will it cause them to maintain peace.


Too much good times, too much of royal goodness,
Ones made and unmade, quick, sudden, neglectful:
Lightly will he believe falsely of his loyal wife,
He put to death through his benevolence.


When a King will be against his people,
A native of Blois will subjugate the Ligurians,
Memel, Cordoba and the Dalmatians,
Of the seven then the shadow to the King, New Year’s money and ghosts.


The shadow of the realm of Navarre untrue,
It will make his life one of fate unlawful:
The vow made in Cambrai wavering,
King Orléans will give a lawful wall.


In life, fate and death a sordid, unworthy man of gold,
He will not be a new Elector of Saxony:
From Brunswick he will send for a sign of love,
The false seducer delivering it to the people.


At the Garland lady of the town of Burgos,
They will impose for the treason committed:
The great prelate of Leon through Formande,
Undone by false pilgrims and ravishers.


Banners of the deepest part of Spain,
Coming out from the tip and ends of Europe:
Troubles passing near the bridge of Laigne,
Its great army will be routed by a band.


Garden of the world near the new city,
In the path of the hollow mountains:
It will be seized and plunged into the Tub,
Forced to drink waters poisoned by sulfur.


The Meuse by day in the land of Luxembourg,
It will find Saturn and three in the urn:
Mountain and plain, town, city and borough,
Flood in Lorraine, betrayed by the great urn.


Some of the lowest places of the land of Lorraine
Will be united with the Low Germans:
Through those of the see Picards, Normans, those of Main,
And they will be joined to the cantons.


At the place where the Lys and the Scheldt unite,
The nuptials will be arranged for a long time:
At the place in Antwerp where they carry the chaff,
Young old age wife undefiled.


The three concubines will fight each other for a long time,
The greatest one the least will remain to watch:
The great Selin will no longer be her patron,
She will call him fire shield white route.


She born in this world of a furtive concubine,
At two raised high by the sad news:
She will be taken captive by her enemies,
And brought to Malines and Brussels.


The unfortunate nuptials will be celebrated
In great joy but the end unhappy:
Husband and mother will slight the daughter-in-law,
The Apollo dead and the daughter-in-law more pitiful.


The royal prelate his bowing too low,
A great flow of blood will come out of his mouth:
The Anglican realm a realm pulled out of danger,
For long dead as a stump alive in Tunis.


The uplifted one will not know his scepter,
He will disgrace the young children of the greatest ones:
Never was there a more filthy and cruel being,
For their wives the king will banish them to death.


In the time of mourning the feline monarch
Will make war upon the young Macedonian:
Gaul to shake, the bark to be in jeopardy,
Marseilles to be tried in the West a talk.


Within Lyons twenty-five of one mind,
Five citizens, Germans, Bressans, Latins:
Under a noble one they will lead a long train,
And discovered by barks of mastiffs.


I weep for Nice, Monaco, Pisa, Genoa,
Savona, Siena, Capua, Modena, Malta:
For the above blood and sword for a New Year's gift,
Fire, the earth will tremble, water an unhappy reluctance.


Betta, Vienna, Emorte, Sopron,
They will want to deliver Pannonia to the Barbarians:
Enormous violence through pike and fire,
The conspirators discovered by a matron.


Near "Sorbia" to assail Hungary,
The herald of "Brudes" (dark ones?) will come to warn them:
Byzantine chief, Salona of Slavonia,
He will come to convert them to the law of the Arabs.


Cydonia, Ragusa, the city of St. Jerome,
With healing help to grow green again:
The King's son dead because of the death of two heroes,
Araby and Hungary will take the same course.


Weep Milan, weep Lucca and Florence,
As your great Duke climbs into the chariot:
The see to change it advances to near Venice,
When at Rome the Colonna will change.


O vast Rome, thy ruin approaches,
Not of thy walls, of thy blood and substance:
The one harsh in letters will make a very horrible notch,
Pointed steel driven into all up to the hilt.


The chief of London through the realm of America,
The Isle of Scotland will be tried by frost:
King and Reb will face an Antichrist so false,
That he will place them in the conflict all together.


A very mighty trembling in the month of May,
Saturn in Capricorn, Jupiter and Mercury in Taurus:
Venus also, Cancer, Mars in Virgo,
Hail will fall larger than an egg.


The army of the sea will stand before the city,
Then it will leave without making a long passage:
A great flock of citizens will be seized on land,
Fleet to return to seize it great robbery.


The shining deed of the old one exalted anew,
Through the South and Aquilon they will be very great:
Raised by his own sister great crowds,
Fleeing, murdered in the thicket of Ambellon.


Through an object the eye will swell very much,
Burning so much that the snow will fall:
The fields watered will come to shrink,
As the primate succumbs at Reggio.


The earth and air will freeze a very great sea,
When they will come to venerate Thursday:
That which will be never was it so fair,
From the four parts they will come to honor it.


The year 1999, seventh month,
From the sky will come a great King of Terror:
To bring back to life the great King of the Mongols,
Before and after Mars to reign by good luck.


The present time together with the past
Will be judged by the great Joker:
The world too late will be tired of him,
And through the clergy oath-taker disloyal.


The year of the great seventh number accomplished,
It will appear at the time of the games of slaughter:
Not far from the great millennial age,
When the buried will go out from their tombs.


Long awaited he will never return
In Europe, he will appear in Asia:
One of the league issued from the great Hermes,
And he will grow over all the Kings of the East.


The great Senate will ordain the triumph
For one who afterwards will be vanquished, driven out:
At the sound of the trumpet of his adherents there will be
Put up for sale their possessions, enemies expelled.


Thirty adherents of the order of Quirites
Banished, their possessions given their adversaries:
All their benefits will be taken as misdeeds,
Fleet dispersed, delivered to the Corsairs.


Sudden joy to sudden sadness,
It will occur at Rome for the graces embraced:
Grief, cries, tears, weeping, blood, excellent mirth,
Contrary bands surprised and trussed up.


The old roads will all be improved,
One will proceed on them to the modern Memphis:
The great Mercury of Hercules fleur-de-lis,
Causing to tremble lands, sea and country.


In the realm the great one of the great realm reigning,
Through force of arms the great gates of brass
He will cause to open, the King and Duke joining,
Fort demolished, ship to the bottom, day serene.


A treasure placed in a temple by Hesperian citizens,
Therein withdrawn to a secret place:
The hungry bonds to open the temple,
Retaken, ravished, a horrible prey in the midst.


Cries, weeping, tears will come with knives,
Seeming to flee, they will deliver a final attack,
Parks around to set up high platforms,
The living pushed back and murdered instantly.


The signal to give battle will not be given,
They will be obliged to go out of the park:
The banner around Ghent will be recognized,
Of him who will cause all his followers to be put to death.


The illegitimate girl so high, high, not low,
The late return will make the grieved ones contended:
The Reconciled One will not be without debates,
In employing and losing all his time.


The old tribune on the point of trembling,
He will be pressed not to deliver the captive:
The will, non-will, speaking the timid evil,
To deliver to his friends lawfully.


Like a griffin will come the King of Europe,
Accompanied by those of Aquilon:
He will lead a great troop of red ones and white ones,
And they will go against the King of Babylon.


A Great King will come to take port near Nice,
Thus the death of the great empire will be completed:
In Antibes will he place his heifer,
The plunder by sea all will vanish.


Foot and Horse at the second watch,
They will make an entry devastating all by sea:
Within the port of Marseilles he will enter,
Tears, cries, and blood, never times so bitter.


The walls will be converted from brick to marble,
Seven and fifty pacific years:
Joy to mortals, the aqueduct renewed,
Health, abundance of fruits, joy and mellifluous times.


A hundred times will the inhuman tyrant die,
In his place put one learned and mild,
The entire Senate will be under his hand,
He will be vexed by a rash scoundrel.


In the year 1609, Roman clergy,
At the beginning of the year you will hold an election:
Of one gray and black issued from Campania,
Never was there one so wicked as he.


Before his father the child will be killed,
The father afterwards between ropes of rushes:
The people of Geneva will have exerted themselves,
The chief lying in the middle like a log.


The new bark will take trips,
There and near by they will transfer the Empire:
Beaucaire, Arles will retain the hostages,
Near by, two columns of Porphyry found.


Scorn from Nîmes, from Arles and Vienne,
Not to obey the Hesperian edict:
To the tormented to condemn the great one,
Six escaped in seraphic garb.


To the Spains will come a very powerful King,
By land and sea subjugating the South:
This evil will cause, lowering again the crescent,
Clipping the wings of those of Friday.


The Religion of the name of the seas will win out
Against the sect of the son of Adaluncatif:
The stubborn, lamented sect will be afraid
Of the two wounded by A and A.


Triremes full of captives of every age,
Good time for bad, the sweet for the bitter:
Prey to the Barbarians hasty they will be too soon,
Anxious to see the feather wail in the wind.


For the merry maid the bright splendor
Will shine no longer, for long will she be without salt:
With merchants, bullies, wolves odious,
All confusion universal monster.


The end of wolf, lion, ox and ass,
Timid deer they will be with mastiffs:
No longer will the sweet manna fall upon them,
More vigilance and watch for the mastiffs.


The great empire will be for England,
The all-powerful one for more than three hundred years:
Great forces to pass by sea and land,
The Lusitanians will not be satisfied thereby.
Almanac of 1555

The soul touched from a distance by the divine spirit presages,
Trouble, famine, plague, war to hasten:
Water, droughts, land and sea stained with blood,
Peace, truce, prelates to be born, princes to die.

The Tyrrhenian Sea, the Ocean for the defense,
The great Neptune and his trident soldiers:
Provence secure because of the hand of the great Tende,
More Mars Narbonne the heroic de Villars.

The big bronze one which regulates the time of day,
Upon the death of the Tyrant it will be dismissed:
Tears, laments and cries, waters, ice bread does not give,
V.S.C. peace, the army will pass away.

Near Geneva terror will be great,
Through the counsel, that cannot fail:
The new King has his league prepare,
The young one dies, famine, fear will cause failure.

O cruel Mars, how you should be feared,
More is the scythe with the silver conjoined:
Fleet, forces, water, wind of shadow to fear,
Sea and land in a truce.  The friends has joined L.V.

For not having a guard you will be more offended,
The weak fort, Pinquiet uneasy and pacific:
They cry "famine," the people are oppressed,
The sea reddens, the Long one proud and iniquitous.

The five, six, fifteen, late and soon they remain,
The heir’s bloodline ended: the cities revolted:
The herald of peace twenty and three return,
The open-hearted five locked up, news invented.

At a distance, near the Aquarius, Saturn turns back,
That year great Mars will give a fire opposition,
Towards the North to the south the great proud female,
Florida in contemplation will hold the port.

Eight, fifteen, and five what disloyalty
The evil spy will come to be permitted:
Fire in the sky, lightning, fear, Papal terror,
The west trembles, pressing too hard the Salty wine.

Six, twelve, thirteen, twenty will speak to the Lady,
The older one by a woman will be corrupted:
Dijon, Guienne hail, lightning makes the first cut into it,
The insatiable one of blood and wine satisfied.

The sky to weep for him, made to do that!
The sea is being prepared, Hannibal to plan his ruse:
Denis [drops anchor], fleet delays, does not remain silent,
Has not known the secret, and by which you are amused!

Venus Neptune will pursue the enterprise,
Pensive one imprisoned, adversaries troubled:
Fleet in the Adriatic, cities towards the Thames,
The fourth clamor, by night, the reposing ones wounded.

The great one of the sky the cape will give,
Relief, Adriatic makes an offer to the port:
He who will be able will save himself from dangers,
By night the Great One wounded pursues.

The port protests too fraudulently and false,
The maw opened, condition of peace:
Rhone in crystal, water, snow, ice stained,
The death, death, wind, through rain the burden broken.


				Almanac of 1558

The young King makes a funeral wedding soon,
Holy one stirred up, feasts, of the said, Mars dormant:
Night tears they cry, they conduct the lady outside,
The arrest and peace broken on all sides.

Vain rumor within the Hierarchy,
Genoa to rebel: courses, offenses, tumults:
For the greater King will be the monarchy,
Election, conflict, covert burials.

Through discord in the absence to fail,
One suddenly will put him back on top:
Towards the North will be noises so loud,
Lesions, points to travel, above.

On the Tyrrhenian Sea, of different sail,
On the Ocean there will be diverse assaults:
Plague, poison, blood in the house of canvas,
Prefects, Legates stirred up to march high seas.

There where the faith was it will be broken,
The enemies will feed upon the enemies:
Fire rains [from the] Sky, it will burn, interrupted,
Enterprise by night.  Chief will make quarrels.

War, thunder, forces fields, depopulated,
Terror and noise, assault on the frontier:
Great Great One fallen, pardon for the exiles,
Germans, Spaniards, by the sea the Barbarian banner.

The noise will be vain, the faltering ones bundled up,
The Shaven Ones captured: the all-powerful One elected:
The two Reds and four true crusaders to fail,
Rain troublesome to the powerful Monarch.

Rain, wind, forces, Barbarossa Hister, the Tyrrhenian Sea,
Vessels to pass Orkneys and beyond Gibraltar, grain and soldiers provided:
Retreats too well executed by Florence, Siena crossed,
The two will be dead, friendships joined.

Venus the beautiful will enter Florence.
The secret exiles will leave the place behind:
Many widows, they deplore the death of the Great One,
To remove from the realm, the Great Great one does not threaten.

Games, feasts, nuptials, dead Prelate of renown.
Noise, peace of truce while the enemy threatens:
Sea, land and sky noise, deed of the great Brennus,
Cries gold, silver, the enemy they ruin.


				Almanac of 1560

Day’s journey, diet, interim, no council,
The year peace is being prepared, plague, schismatic famine:
Put outside inside, sky to change, domicile,
End of holiday, hierarchical revolt.

Diet to break up, the ancient sacred one to recover,
Under the two, fire through pardon to result:
Consecration without arms: the tall Red will want to have,
Peace of neglect, the Elected One, the Widower, to live.

To be made to appear elected with novelty,
Place of day-labor to go beyond the boundaries:
The feigned goodness to change to cruelty,
From the suspected place quickly will they all go out.

With the place chosen, the Shaved Ones will not be contented,
Led from Lake Geneva, unproven,
They will cause the old times to be renewed:
They will expose the frighten off the plot so well hatched.

Savoy peace will be broken,
The last hand will cause a strong levy:
The great conspirator will not be corrupted,
And the new alliance approved.

A long comet to wrong the Governor,
Hunger, burning fever, fire and reek of blood:
To all estates Jovial Ones in great honor,
Sedition by the Shaven ones, ignited.

Plague, famine, fire and ardor incessant,
Lightning, great hail, temple struck from the sky:
The Edict, arrest, and grievous law broken,
The chief inventor his people and himself snatched up.

Deprived will be the Shaven Ones of their arms,
It will augment their quarrel much:
Father Liber deceived lightning Albanians,
Sects will be gnawed to the marrow.

The modest request will be received,
They will be driven out and then restored on top:
The Great Great woman will be found content,
Blind ones, deaf ones will be put uppermost.

He will not be placed, the New Ones expelled,
Black king and the Great One will hold hard:
To have recourse to arms.  Exiles expelled further,
To sing of victory, not free, consolation.

The mourning left behind, supreme alliances,
Great Shaven One dead, refusal given at the entrance:
Upon return kindness to be in oblivion,
The death of the just one perpetrated at a banquet.


				Almanac of 1562

Season of winter, good spring, sound, bad summer,
Pernicious autumn, dry, wheat rare:
Of wine enough, bad eyes, deeds, molested,
War, mutiny, seditious waste.

The hidden desire for the good will succeed,
Religion, peace, love and concord:
The nuptial song will not be completely in accord,
The high ones, who are low, and high, put to the rope.

For the Shaven Ones the Chief will not reach the end,
Edicts changed, the secret ones set at large:
Great One found dead, less of faith, low standing,
Dissimulated, shuddering, wounded in the boar’s lair.

Moved by Lion, near Lion he will undermine,
Taken, captive, pacified by a woman:
He will not hold as well as they will waver,
Placed unpassed, to oust the soul from rage.

From Lion he will come to arouse to move,
Vain discovery against infinite people:
Known by none the evil for the duty,
In the kitchen found dead and finished.

Nothing in accord, worse and more severe trouble,
As it was, land and sea to quieten:
All arrested, it will not be worth a double,
The iniquitous one will speak, Counsel of annihilation.

Portentous deed, horrible and incredible,
Typhoon will make the wicked ones move:
Those who then afterwards supported by the cable,
And the greater part exiled on the fields.

Right put on the throne come into France from the sky,
The whole world pacified by Virtue:
Much blood to scatter, sooner change to come,
By the birds, and by fire, and not by vers.

The colored ones, the Sacred malcontents,
Then suddenly through the happy Androgynes:
Of the great part to see, the time not come,
Several amongst them will make their soups weak.

They will be returned to their full power,
Conjoined at one point of the accord, not in accord:
All defied, more promised to the Shaven Ones,
Several amongst them outflanked in a band.

For the legate of terrestrial and dawn,
The great Cape will accommodate himself to all:
Tacit LORRAINE, to be listening,
He whose advice they will not want to agree with.

The enemy wind will impede the troop,
For the greatest one advance put in difficulty:
Wine with poison will be put in the cup,
To pass the great gun without horse-power.

Through crystal the enterprise is broken,
Games and feats, in LYONS to repose more:
No longer will he take his repast with the Great Ones,
Sudden catarrh, blessed water, to bathe him.
Almanac of 1564

The sextile year rains, wheat to abound, hatreds,
Joy to men, Princes, King divorced:
Herd to perish, human mutations,
People oppressed and poison under the surface.

Times very diverse, discord discovered,
Council of war, change taken in, changed:
The Great Woman must not be, conspirators through water lost,
Great hostility, for the great one all steady.

The bit of the enemy's tongue approaches,
The Debonair one to peace will want to reduce:
The obstinate ones will want to lose the kinswoman,
Surprised, Captives, and suspects fury to injure.

Fathers and mothers dead of infinite sorrows,
Women in mourning, the pestilent she-monster:
The Great One to be no more, all the world to end,
Under peace, repose and every single one in opposition.

Princes and Christendom stirred up in debates,
Foreign nobles, Christ's See molested:
Become very evil, much good, mortal sight.
Death in the East, plague, famine, evil treaty.

Land to tremble, killed, wasteful, monster,
Captives without number, to do, undone, done:
To go over the sea misfortune will occur,
Proud against the proud evil done in disguise.

The unjust one lowered, they will molest him fiercely,
Hail, to flood, treasure, and engraved marble:
Chief of Persuasion people will kill to death,
And attached will be the blade to the tree.

Of what not evil? inexcusable result,
The fire not double, the Legate outside confused:
Against the worse wounded the fight will not be made,
The end of June the thread cut by firing.

Fine bonds enfeebled by accords,
Mars and Prelates united will not stop:
The great ones confused by gifts of mutilated bodies,
Dignified ones, undignified ones will seize the well endowed.

From good to the evil times will change,
The peace in the South, the expectation of the Greatest Ones:
The Great Ones grieving Louis too much more will stumble,
Well-known Shaven Ones have neither power not understanding.

This is the month for evils so many as to be doubled,
Deaths, plague to drain all, famine, to quarrel:
Those of the reverse of exile will come to note,
Great Ones, secrets, deaths, not to censure.

Through death, death to bite, counsel, robbery, pestiferous,
They will not dare to attack the Marines:
Deucalion a final trouble to make,
Few young people: half-dead to give a start.

Dead through spite he will cause the others to shine,
And in an exalted place some great evils to occur:
Sad concepts will come to harm each one,
Temporal dignified, the Mass to succeed.


				Almanac of 1566

For the greatest ones death, loss of honor and violence,
Professors of the faith, their estate and their sect:
For the two great Churches diverse noise, decadence,
Evil neighbors quarreling serfs of the Church without a head.

Waste, great loss, and not without violence,
All those of the faith, more for religion,
The Greatest Ones will lose their lives, their honor and fortunes
Both the two Churches, the sin in their faction.

For the two very Great Ones pernicious loss to arise,
The Greatest Ones will cause loss, goods, of honor, and of life,
As much great noises will run, the urn very odious,
Great maladies to be, meeting-house, mass in envy.

The servants of the Churches will betray their Lords,
Of other Lords also by the undivided of the fields:
Neighbors of meeting-house and mass will quarrel amongst them,
Rumors, noises to augment, to death are several lying.

Of all blessings abundance, the earth will produce for us,
No din of war in France, sedition put outside:
Man-slayers, robbers one will find on the highway,
Little faith, burning fever, people in commotion.

Between people discord, brutal enmity,
War, death of great Princes, several parts:
Universal plague, stronger in the West,
Times good and full, but very dry and exhausted.

The grains not to be plentiful, in all other fruits, plenty,
The Summer, spring humid, winter long, snow, ice:
The East in arms, France reinforces herself,
Death of beasts much honey, the place to be besieged.

Through pestilence and fire fruits of trees will perish,
Signs of oil to abound.  Father Denis not scarce:
Some great ones to die, but few foreigners will sally forth in attack,
Offense, Barbarian marines, and dangers at the frontiers.

Rains very excessive, and of blessings abundance,
The cattle price to be just, women outside of danger:
Hail, rain, thunder: people depressed in France,
Through death they will work, death to reprove people.

Arms, plagues to cease, death of the seditious ones,
Great Father Liber will not much abound:
Evil ones will be seized by more malicious ones,
France more than ever victorious will triumph.

Up to this month the great drought will endure,
For Italy and Provence all fruits to half:
The Great One less of enemies prisoner of their band,
For the scroungers, Pirates, and the enemy to die.

The enemy so much to be feared to retire into Thrace,
Leaving cries, howls, and pillage desolated:
To leave noise on sea and land, religion murdered,
Jovial Ones put on the road, every sect to become angry.
